# React Firebase Blog App
This is my first React project (Didn't focus much on the design part lol). A Full-stack web app for blog posting, built with React 18 (Typescript), Tailwind CSS, and Firebase (Firebase Auth, Firestore DB). Users can authenticate, create posts, like them, and comment on them. You can visit the demo [React Blog Demo](https://react-blog-snowy-nu.vercel.app).

## Getting Started
Don't forget to put your Firebase app key in the env file.
```
cp .env.example .env
npm / yarn / pnpm install
npm / yarn / pnpm dev
```
